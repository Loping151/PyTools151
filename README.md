# Pytools151

Useful debugging tools, my favored implementations, and templates for convenient Python coding.

All the code are written casually during my daily development, and I hope they can be helpful to you as well. It is not a package. Just copy and paste the code you need.

## Analysis

Code here are used to analysis, for example, to measure the runtime using a timer.

<details>
<summary>timer</summary>

Include a `Timer` class that simulates a stopwatch to measure the runtime of your code. It supports `lap` and `reset` operations. You can log the time each time you lap or sum up the time spent in a certain interval inside a loop. See examples in the code.

</details>


<details>
<summary>searcher</summary>

Include two funny wrappers that catch your error messages and search online through Baidu or StackOverflow.
